Welcome to Recommendation Framework!
====================================

Recommendation Framework is a Django application that provides item recommendations for users. The simplest form of
recommendations now are based on collaborative filtering tensor matrix. The framework also ships with a set of filters
and re-rankers to give more juice to the recommendation. The point of the framework is to flexible enough to adapt to
most of the services. For this purpose is possible to develop and deploy within the framework "recommendation" plugins
to improve the recommendation, to make it more flexible or whathever some brilliant mind want the framework to do.

Get Started
-----------

To get started with the Recommendation framework, you first need to set a Django environment. Do all the thing you need
to do in order to start your django project. If you don't now how to do it you're a bit ahead of yourself. Just check
the `Django <http://djangoproject.com>`_ website and see if it's what you're looking for.

Installation
____________

Like all the good python python packages you just use "`pip install recommendation-framework`" and you're ready to go.
Unfortunately this project doesn't even got a real name. As far as I'm concerned it will be called frappe or something
coffee and cream related. Why? This project is the younger brother of the `Frappé
<http://frappe.cc/>`_ another recommendation project developed by `Linas Baltrunas
<http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=34647483>`_, the same guy behind this here. So, in this alpha stage of the
project, to get it just ask nicely to `Linas <mailto:linas.baltrunas@gmail.com>`_ or `João <mailto:joaonrb@gmail.com>`_
and we will think about it. If for some reason they think they worthy you just have to add the package to you
environment.

After that just add the it to the installed apps in Django settings:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # settings.py

   INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...  # A ton of cool Django apps
        "recommendation",
        ...
   )

Okay, now you can have ways to retrieve recommendations from the system. Link your users to the
recommendation.models.User and the items you want to be subject of recommendation to recommendation.models.Item.
One more thing. To retrieve recommendations a special matrix must be built. To have it built you have to run the
script:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   >>> modelcrafter.py make

This script is shipping with the recommendation framework and it build this matrix. You will want to continue to build
the matrix for new users and items to be included. Keep that in mind.

And voilá, you get your self a recommendation system for your precious little web site. It's a bit static though.

Plugin Installations
____________________

To remove the "staticness" of the recommendations you can always install new plugins. The recommendation framework ships
with some pretty neat plugins. Installed in the same way any Django app is installed. Just keep and mind one thing. In
case of re-rankers and filters, your system may what some actions to occur before others. For instance, you may want
that your recommendation have always a big diversity in genre but that don't send every time the same items. So you will
have to register the diversity first and the logging after.


.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # settings.py

   INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...  # A ton of cool Django apps
        "recommendation",
        "recommendation.diversity",  # First do diversity
        "recommendation.records",  # Than re-rank based on records
        ...
   )
