Create slideshows, banners, drop down menus, 3D effects, text effects, mini games, animated layouts, and much more.\nVisually create stunning browser controlled HTML5 / CSS3 transition based animations!\n\n***\nNodeFire is a full online visual environment for professional web developers and designers.  Quickly design banners, advertisements, text effects, hierarchical drop down menus, scrolling items, marquees, interactive animations, buttons, mini games, 3D effects, and much more.\n\n***\nNodeFire generates true browser controlled CSS3 transitions and extends the browsers limited animation capabilities with scripted key frames when required. NodeFire is the first and only hybrid capable animation tool on the internet (script and browser run CSS3 transition animations at the same time).\n\n***\nCSS3 transition animations automatically convert to scripted key frames in old browsers. Animations work in all browsers back to IE7 (or optionally deliver alternate content).\n\n***\nAnimate anything!  Virtually every CSS style setting is offered in a compact visual tree and can be applied to any stage element, groups of stage elements, or to CSS rules. Add numeric and non-numeric settings to your timelines.\n\n***\nCreate unlimited visually select-able event driven timelines without writing complicated scripts which is typical in other animation tools.  Visually select and trigger timelines on document ready, load, image preload, mouse down, mouse over, click, active, and more!\n\n***\nAnimate CSS rules!  Select rules and apply CSS styles and key frames like you would with a standard stage element. Like elements, rules animate smooth and fast by using browser controlled CSS3 transitions.\n\n***\nCreate widgets and complex layout type effects with ease by selecting from the numerous element create tools. Rotating 3D polygons, slide shows, drop down menus, grids and more are simple to visually apply and work with.\n\n***\nExtend the capabilities of CSS3 transitions with offset component style frames.  For example, NodeFire allows a CSS3 transform rotate animation to run while a transform scaleXY animation of a different duration is triggered on the same element. Further extend CSS3 transition capabilities with scripted key values, old browser support, event triggered timelines, and more.\n\n***\nAdd an extra dimension to your project with 3D transform style settings.  Animate, rotate, scale, and translate any element on the x, y, or z axis.\n\n***\nExtend the standard CSS3 transition cubic-bezier options with true multi-step bounce and elastic easing.  Apply different ease settings to individual component value key frames of a single style.\n\n***\nNodeFire is a standards based design tool.  Published stage code is compact and clean while conforming to the latest browser standards. A full API allows for scripted control and communication with your stage animations.\n  \n***\nWith NodeFire, web developers can quickly design robust CSS3 transition animations that run identical in all browsers (modern and old), tablets, and smart phones. Visually leverage the full power of the browsers CSS3 transition support and then go beyond it to create stunning effects with NodeFires hybrid scripted key frame capabilities.", "default_locale": "en-US", "listed_authors": [{"name": "nodefire"}], "price": null, "previews": [{"filetype": "image/png", "caption": "Main Interface", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/96/96434.png?modified=1365625822", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/96/96434.png?modified=1365625822", "id": "96434", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/96434/"}], "payment_account": null, "categories": [158], "supported_locales": [], "price_locale": null, "name": "NodeFire - HTML5 Animator", "created": "2013-04-10T06:21:32", "device_types": ["desktop"], "payment_required": false, "weekly_downloads": null, "image_assets": {"featured_tile": ["https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/imageassets/9/9262.png?modified=1365600619", 0], "mobile_tile": ["https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/imageassets/9/9264.png?modified=1365600619", 0], "desktop_tile": ["https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/imageassets/9/9266.png?modified=1365600619", 0]}, "upsell": false, "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/app/429820/"}
