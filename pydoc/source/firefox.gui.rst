ffos.gui - FireFox OS Store Graphical Interface
===============================================

The ffos.gui provides a simple way to check users, installed apps and their
recommendations according with this system.

Views
-----

This provides 2 types of view. User listing and recommendation per user. The
following mockups are the first version before implementation and probably are
a bit different from the future versions.

    - The :download:`landing<../../mockups/landing.html>` page.
    - The :download:`recomendation<../../mockups/recomendations.html>` page.

Note that this mockups work more as a guide lines. All the data is very dummy
and it has no action what so ever. And it doesn't have icons.
