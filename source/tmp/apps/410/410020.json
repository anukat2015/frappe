Shoot quadz from\n                repositories around the field to form groups of 3 or\n                more quadz of the same color which then\n                disappear. Only quadz that are at the edge of a\n                repository and have an obstacle (another quad) to hit\n                can move into the field. Quadz continue to move in the\n                same direction when their obstacle is removed in the\n                order they entered the field.\n\n                You can undo <em>one</em> move. You can discard board\n                state and start over (reset level).\n\n                Some levels have a level word. This means that some\n                quadz carry letters of that word. Quadz with letters\n                must be killed in a particular sequence to spell level\n                word (displayed at the top right). If field is cleared\n                before word is complete you fail.\n\n                Killing a group of 4 quadz adds one of the\n                remaining letters to a quad off of the field, or, if\n                the word is complete, turns it into a wildcard\n                quad that can be used in place of any color.\n\n                Killing a group of 5 quadz adds a wildcard letter\n                <strong>*</strong> to a quad off of the\n                field. Once the word is complete, all remaining\n                wildcard letters become wildcard quadz. Killing a\n                group of 5 after word is complete (or if level has no\n                word) adds a wildcard quad in a shooting position.\n\n                Killing more than one group of quadz with one shot\n                turns a quad in a shooting position into a\n                bomb. Killing 2 quad groups yields one bomb, 3 - two\n                bombs, etc. Bomb is a special quad that kills\n                everything around (including rocks) when it stops at\n                an obstacle. Using a bomb results in penalty,  1\n                point per quad killed.\n\n                Bombs may appear in initial level\n                layout. They detonate if hit by another quad.\n\n                Rock is a special quad that may only appear on the\n                field in initial level layout. Rocks can only be\n                removed with a bomb. It is not necessary to remove\n                rocks to clear the field. Rocks remaining on the field\n                when it is cleared of all other quadz earn extra points.\n\n                Color changer is a special field cell. Any reqular\n                quad that moves through a color changer cell changes\n                it's color to a random different one. This doesn't\n                affect bombs and wildcards.\n\n                Redirectors are special field cells. Any quad\n                that moves through a redirector changes\n                it's direction to one indicated by the cell.\n\n                All unused bombs and wildcards earn extra bonus points\n                when field is cleared.\n\n                Good luck!"}, "device_types": ["desktop"], "homepage": {"en-US": "http://quadz.8x.to"}, "icons": {"16": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/410/410020-32.png?modified=1355437278", "48": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/410/410020-48.png?modified=1355437278", "128": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/410/410020-128.png?modified=1355437278", "64": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/410/410020-64.png?modified=1355437278"}, "id": 410020, "is_packaged": false, "manifest_url": "http://quadz.8x.to/free/manifest.webapp", "name": {"en-US": "Quadz"}, "payment_account": null, "payment_required": false, "premium_type": "free", "previews": [{"filetype": "image/png", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/83/83334.png?modified=1354059236", "id": 83334, "resource_uri": null, "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/83/83334.png?modified=1354059236"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/83/83336.png?modified=1354059236", "id": 83336, "resource_uri": null, "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/83/83336.png?modified=1354059236"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/83/83338.png?modified=1354059235", "id": 83338, "resource_uri": null, "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/83/83338.png?modified=1354059235"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/83/83340.png?modified=1354059236", "id": 83340, "resource_uri": null, "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/83/83340.png?modified=1354059236"}], "price": null, "price_locale": null, "privacy_policy": "/api/v1/apps/app/410020/privacy/", "public_stats": false, "release_notes": null, "ratings": {"count": 1, "average": 5.0}, "regions": [{"name": "Argentina", "slug": "ar", "mcc": 722, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Chile", "slug": "cl", "mcc": 730, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Colombia", "slug": "co", "mcc": 732, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Spain", "slug": "es", "mcc": 214, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Greece", "slug": "gr", "mcc": 202, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Hungary", "slug": "hu", "mcc": 216, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Italy", "slug": "it", "mcc": 222, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Montenegro", "slug": "me", "mcc": 297, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Mexico", "slug": "mx", "mcc": 334, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Peru", "slug": "pe", "mcc": 716, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Poland", "slug": "pl", "mcc": 260, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Serbia", "slug": "rs", "mcc": 220, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "uk", "mcc": 235, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "United States", "slug": "us", "mcc": 310, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Uruguay", "slug": "uy", "mcc": 748, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Venezuela", "slug": "ve", "mcc": 734, "adolescent": true}, {"name": "Worldwide", "slug": "worldwide", "mcc": null, "adolescent": true}], "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/app/410020/", "slug": "quadz", "status": 4, "summary": null, "support_email": {"en-US": "quadz@8x.to"}, "support_url": {"en-US": "http://quadz.8x.to/issues/"}, "supported_locales": [], "tags": [], "upsell": false, "upsold": null, "user": null, "versions": {"1.0.4": "/api/v1/apps/versions/1400260/"}, "weekly_downloads": null}
