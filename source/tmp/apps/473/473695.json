E.g. see on a map which way Jesus or Paul traveled, and see the stories that happened there. Discover the Bible interactively: By person, by time, or by location.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Bible mentions a lot of historic persons, with complex human relations, and ancient places that often no longer exist and we thus have no imagination of. Also, like today, there are many \"Mary\"s and \"James\".\n\nThis app tries to help making the Bible more explorable, by allowing to click on a name and seeing everything about that person. You can explore their family tree, see their places on a map, and the events they were involved in. You can jump to that event and read about it in the Bible. When \"Capernaum\" is mentioned, you can see it on a map, and what else happened on that place and who else was there.\n\nAt the moment, the content is still very limited. Eventually, if this effort can be completed, you should be able to get a list of all Bible events, in order of time, and read the Bible - e.g. the gospels - in a chronological order of the events instead of book by book. But it's not there yet.\n\nThe app contains the whole bible, and you will have the whole text stored on your phone, so you can read the Bible without Internet connection. The \"Personal reading\" feature stores where you left off. Set the bookmark by clicking on a verse number, then click on \"Set bookmark\".\n\nCaveats and known bugs\n   <ul>    <li>Although I'm a professional software developer, I have developed this app in my free time, so the quality is necessarily limited.</li>    <li>Content is very limited, as I added all content manually myself.</li>    <li>I may add Bible explanations in the future, and switch to another Bible translation.</li>    <li>No keyword search in Bible text. You can search for known persons, though.</li>    <li>Scrolling over the genealogy graph doesn't work. This is a Firefox OS bug. However, you can scroll with your finger at the very left, in the left page margin.</li>   </ul>"}, "homepage": {"en-US": "http://mappa.bucksch.org"}, "icons": {"16":
